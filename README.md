# Openingtree
Code for [openingtree.com](https://www.openingtree.com). It downloads chess games in form of a pgn from any source, applies specified filters, and constructs an openingtree. 
The tree is visualized on a chessboard. It also shows win percentages and other statistics with different moves.

## Why this is

Webpack is the recommended means for Cloudflare Worker developers to leverage
`npm`'s massive, modular ecosystem. But to those unfamiliar with Webpack's
~~black magic~~ configuration, it can mean investing countless hours in
tooling-tweaks and `.*rc`-file-fiddling.

So the goal, here, is to provide a fiddle-free, Webpack-powered launchpad with
default settings sane enough for almost any use case.

It'll bundle up your script and dependencies, upload your Worker to Cloudflare,
and even activate its route(s). The world's now yours to `require('üåç')`

### What you configure

- Your Cloudflare credentials
- Your site name (FQDN) or Cloudflare Zone-Id
- (Optional) One or more route matching patterns for your Worker

### What you get

- Transparent, optimized and ready-to-rock Webpack configuration file
- Babel configuration ensuring development-setup build compatibility for Node 8+
  and script compatibility with the latest V8 runtime
- On-demand polyfilling in the (very unlikely) event that it's needed
- Baked-in management of route patterns
- Minification of Worker scripts to keep them under the 1MB limit
- A deployable example to demonstrate `require` and other neat features
- Access to secret keys, tokens, and certificates using
  [CF-Worker secrets vault](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/api/resource-bindings/secrets-vault/)
- **Namespace resource bindings for the funky-fresh new
  [Workers KV](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/kv/) üëè**

### Requirements

- Node 8 or later
- Cloudflare account with domain

## Quick Start

1.  Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:detroitenglish/cloudflare-workers-webpack-boilerplate.git

    cd cloudflare-workers-webpack-boilerplate
    ```

2.  Rename `example.env` to `.env` , and add your required Cloudflare
    credentials, and either your site name or site's zone-id.
3.  Install dependencies with `npm install`
4.  Write your worker script in `src/worker.js`
    - Install any dependencies for your worker with:
      `npm install -P <some-npm-module>`
    - Build a preview of your bundled worker script in `dist/bundled-worker.js`
      by running: `npm run build`
5.  Build, bundle and launch your ~~minion~~ Worker to the Cloudflare Edge üöÄ
    using: `npm run deploy`

### Example Cloudflare Worker

A ready-to-rock example Worker script can be found in `src/example.worker.js`.

The example Worker `require()`s
[lodash.sample](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash.sample), and uses it to
randomly choose a translation of the word 'hello'.

It then adds a response header in the form of:

```text
x-worker-greeting: <random-hello>, world!
```

#### Using the Example Worker

After completing steps 1-3 above, you can build the example script with
`npm run build:example`

You can deploy it live to your site with `npm run deploy:example`

To get the full experience, create a
[KV Namespace](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/api/resource-bindings/kv-namespaces/#body-inner)
and add its `namespace_id` to `src/example.metadata.json`

## Configuration

### Required Config

#### Cloudflare Credentials

The following are **required** in your `.env` file:

- `CLOUDFLARE_AUTH_EMAIL`: Your Cloudflare account email address

- `CLOUDFLARE_AUTH_KEY`: Your Cloudflare API-Key

#### Site Identification

You **must** provide a means of identifying your Cloudflare site deployment
target by defining (in `.env`) either:

- `CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID`: The Zone ID to which your worker will be deployed

or

- `CLOUDFLARE_SITE_NAME`: The fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of your site,
  e.g. _example.lol_

### Additional Config

More options are defined and described in [`example.env`](./example.env)

## Default Settings & Behaviors (Advanced)

### Minification

Webpack is configured to minify scripts before deployment in order to help keep
your bundled Worker under the 1MB limit.

Building previews with `npm run build` will **not** minify scripts in order to
make debugging easier.

### CloudflareWorkerPlugin

Worker script uploading and route pattern management are handled by the this
same author's
[`cloudflare-worker-webpack-plugin`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cloudflare-worker-webpack-plugin).
You can review the plugin's source code and documentation
[here](https://github.com/detroitenglish/cloudflare-worker-webpack-plugin).

### Babel Configuration

Babel is configured to let you use JavaScript syntaxes and features that are
supported in the latest version of Chrome, but **not natively supported by
NodeJS**, e.g. `import "statements"` or `{ ...objectSpreadSyntax }`.

On build, Babel will only add polyfills to your bundled script if, after
evaluating your code, it determines a polyfill is necessary for compatibility
with the latest version of Chrome (a _very_ unlikely scenario).

### Custom `.env` Variables

See [`example.env`](./example.env) for details and examples on adding and
injecting custom variables.

### Cloudflare Worker Secrets Vault

See [`example.env`](./example.env) for details and examples on including a
`metadata.json` secrets file.

### Route Patterns

See [`example.env`](./example.env) for details and examples on how route
patterns are parsed and deployed.

## Development

### Testing and Issue Reporting

I am not a Cloudflare employee, so as a peasant my testing is limited to my own
Workers, in my own zones for my own application in production.

So by all means, try to break stuff! And if something goes kaputt, please let me
know by
[creating an issue](https://github.com/detroitenglish/cloudflare-worker-webpack-boilerplate/issues).

### Contributing

PRs are very much welcome üëç

Committing will trigger - and must pass - linting and a few tests
([...which there could be more of!](https://media1.giphy.com/media/74d1H50VBuE2A/giphy.gif))

Fork away!

### Roadmap

Some ideas going forward:

- [x] Replace zone-id requirement with automatic zone-lookup of FQDN
- [ ] Setup CI for deployment tests with the Cloudflare API
- [ ] ~~Support single-shot deployment to multiple zones~~ Meh...
- [x] Add argument parsing (or actual binary?) for deployment via pure CLI

But I'm very open to suggestions - please share your ideas by
[creating an issue](https://github.com/detroitenglish/cloudflare-worker-webpack-boilerplate/issues).
